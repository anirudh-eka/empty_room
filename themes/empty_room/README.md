# Empty Room

A [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) theme for the [Empty Room piece](http://toomanynames.com/empty_room/). 

## A word on dependancies

This theme 'extends' the [toomanynames theme](https://github.com/anirudh-eka/toomanynames_theme), which is added as a node module.

It uses [paperjs](http://paperjs.org/about/) to do graphics, which is added as a bower component, and provides music via the [Soundcloud API](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api).

## Update

Execute the following commands in the root directory of the theme.

To update the toomanynames theme (and any other node modules):

```
	$ npm update
```

To update paperjs, jquery (and any other bower components):

```
	$ bower update
```
